# OilCert — Setup Checklist

This is the punch-list of external integrations that still need your action. The codebase
is ready; these are the values you need to plug in (or decisions you need to make) before the
site is fully live and tracked.

---

## 1. GitHub repo transfer
- [ ] Push the local repo to **github.com/danielcrypto1/oilcert** (Claude does this in setup)
- [ ] Transfer the repo: **GitHub Settings → Danger Zone → Transfer** to **utilitiescombined-lang**
- [ ] After transfer, update `render.yaml` `repo:` to `https://github.com/utilitiescombined-lang/oilcert` and push that commit (Claude does this once you confirm the transfer is complete)

## 2. Render web service
- [ ] Render → New → **Blueprint** → connect the repo at utilitiescombined-lang/oilcert
- [ ] Render reads `render.yaml` automatically. Verify:
  - Service name: `oilcert`
  - Build: `npm install`
  - Start: `node server.js`
  - Plan: free
  - Health check: `/api/health`
- [ ] Set the env var `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` (paste the Google service account JSON inline) so the booking form creates calendar events
- [ ] First deploy should take ~3–5 minutes. Confirm `https://oilcert.onrender.com` returns the homepage.

## 3. DNS — Namecheap (oilcert.co.uk → Advanced DNS)
- [ ] **Delete** the default `CNAME www → parkingpage.namecheap.com`
- [ ] **Delete** the default `URL Redirect @ → http://www.oilcert.co.uk/`
- [ ] **Add A record**: `@ → 216.24.57.1` (Render apex IP)
- [ ] **Add CNAME record**: `www → oilcert.onrender.com.` (note the trailing dot)
- [ ] **Leave alone**: the email forwarding `TXT` (SPF) record — that's keeping `oilcert@utilitiescombined.co.uk` working
- [ ] Wait 5–30 minutes for the zone to propagate
- [ ] Verify with `nslookup oilcert.co.uk dns1.registrar-servers.com` — the SOA serial increments when the update is live
- [ ] In Render → Settings → Custom Domains: add **oilcert.co.uk** and **www.oilcert.co.uk**, accept the auto-issued Let's Encrypt cert

## 4. Email — Namecheap forwarder
- [x] **Already done by you**: `oilcert@utilitiescombined.co.uk` forwarder is set up in Namecheap
- [ ] Send a test message to confirm it lands in the inbox you're forwarding to

## 5. Analytics & tracking — replace placeholder IDs

The codebase still carries the **Electricert / UC** analytics IDs, on purpose, so your replacements
are visible at a glance. Find each ID via repo-wide search and swap in the OilCert-specific values:

- [ ] **Google Tag Manager** — replace `GTM-MPGJV5DC` (3 files: `index.html`, `pages/findings.html`, `pages/about.html`, plus other pages copied from the same template). Easiest: PowerShell regex replace across the tree.
- [ ] **Google Ads conversion tag** — replace `AW-18046002549` everywhere
- [ ] **Microsoft Clarity** — replace the placeholder `XXXXXXXXXX` everywhere

Once swapped, deploy and verify each tag in **GTM Preview**, **Clarity Live**, and **Google Ads → Tools → Tag Diagnostics**.

## 6. Google Search Console
- [ ] Add property: `https://oilcert.co.uk/`
- [ ] Verify via DNS TXT record (Namecheap → Advanced DNS → add TXT)
- [ ] Submit sitemap: `https://oilcert.co.uk/sitemap.xml`
- [ ] Check coverage weekly for the first month

## 7. Google Business Profile
- [ ] Decide whether to add OilCert as a service to the existing UC GBP **or** create a new GBP listing
- [ ] If new: same NAP (name/address/phone) as UC, primary category "Heating Contractor", secondary "Boiler Supplier"
- [ ] Add OFTEC registration number to the profile
- [ ] Link the profile back to **oilcert.co.uk**
- [ ] Set up Google Reviews link in the GBP — replace the existing UC review link in `index.html` if you want OilCert-specific reviews

## 8. Calendly
- [x] **Decision: skip for now.** UC has not created an oilcert-specific Calendly event type
- [x] No Calendly link is present in the booking flow (intentionally removed). The form submits via `/api/book` and the WhatsApp/phone CTAs are the only secondary booking paths
- [ ] When you create the Calendly event, add a single CTA back into the booking section in `index.html` — do not add a fallback that 404s

## 9. Anthropic API key (for installer AI rewrite)
- [ ] Get an API key from https://console.anthropic.com (look for `sk-ant-...`)
- [ ] In the deployed admin panel: **Settings → AI Settings → paste the key → Save**
- [ ] OR set `AI_API_KEY` as a Render env var (preferred — survives redeploys)
- [ ] The AI rewrite prompts already reference OFTEC TI/133, OFTEC TI/134, BS 5410 and Building Regs Part J — see `server.js` `AI_PROMPTS`

## 10. Real Findings page
- [x] Hidden from nav, footer, sitemap and marked `noindex, nofollow` until you upload findings with photos
- [ ] When you have at least 3 approved findings with before/after photos, **un-noindex** `pages/findings.html`, add it back to `sitemap.xml`, and re-add the nav link in every page

## 11. Hero image — final QA
- [x] Hero `images/cover.webp` uses `object-fit: contain` with a warm amber gradient backdrop and a 4/5 aspect ratio (per the lessons-learned brief)
- [ ] If you have a higher-resolution version of the gear+drop hero, drop it in at `images/cover.webp` (must be webp, ideally 1200×1500 for retina)

## 12. Favicon
- [x] Currently uses the full-colour logo (`images/favicon.png` = a 233 KB copy of the logo PNG)
- [ ] **Optional:** generate a proper favicon set (16×16, 32×32, 180×180 apple-touch-icon, 192/512 PWA icons) at https://realfavicongenerator.net and replace the single PNG. The current setup works but pays a small KB cost on first load.

## 13. Branding — testing.png leftover
- [x] The signs section currently uses **text-only single-column layout** (the old electrical fuse-board image was removed)
- [ ] If you want to re-add a companion image, drop a 4/5 aspect-ratio oil-themed photo at `images/signs.webp` and update `pages/tips.html` and `index.html` to reference it. The CSS class `signs-grid-text` becomes `signs-grid` again to restore the two-column layout.
- [ ] `images/testing.png` (2.5 MB old electrical fuse-board photo) is unreferenced and can be deleted

## 14. Reviews on the homepage
- [x] The four reviews on the homepage are **rewritten as oil-heating equivalents** of the originals — they are placeholder copy that reads naturally for the new domain
- [ ] Replace each with a real verified Google review as soon as you have them. Update `aggregateRating.reviewCount` in the JSON-LD block in `index.html` to match the real count.

## 15. Phone / WhatsApp
- [x] Phone: `01442 601 383` (UC main line)
- [x] WhatsApp: `wa.me/441442601383`
- [x] Booking confirmation messages reference "oil boiler service" rather than "EICR"

## 16. Sister-brand cross-links
- [x] Footer cross-links to **utilitiescombined.co.uk**, **electricert.co.uk** and **plumcert.co.uk**
- [x] About page mentions the sibling brands and links them
- [ ] Reciprocate from the Plumcert and Electricert footers — a single in-content link in each direction materially helps SEO

## 17. First test booking
- [ ] After DNS goes live, submit one booking through the form and confirm:
  - The lead lands in `data/leads.json` (visible in admin panel → Leads)
  - A calendar event is created in the linked Google Calendar (assuming `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` is set)
  - The phone and WhatsApp deep links work on a real phone
